# Optimizing Hospital Bed Utilization with Bonsai and SimPy

This project demonstrates how to integrate [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) discrete event simulations with the [Microsoft Bonsai](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/product/) deep reinforcement learning platform.

In this demo, we train a deep reinforcement learning system to optimize utilization of hospital beds with random patient arrivals.

## Quickstart / Setup Guide

### Installation Requirements

- Access to a Bonsai workspace (see [Microsoft account setup for Bonsai](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/guides/account-setup)), including [workspace ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/cookbook/get-workspace-info) and [access key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/cookbook/get-access-key)

- Python 3.7+

- Python dependencies, including the [Bonsai API](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api) (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) for details)

Note: installing the Python dependencies in a virtual environment or Docker container is strongly recommended.

The following dependencies are optional but recommended:

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
- [Bonsai CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/cli/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

### Running the Simulator Locally

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new `.env` file in the root of the project folder, and add your workspace credentials.  See [template.env](./template.env) for an example.
3. Build a local Docker container with `docker build -t hospital .`
4. Run the local Docker container with `docker run --env-file .env hospital`

You can now create and train a new brain on the Bonsai platform using the locally running simulator.

### Building the Simulator Image

Unmanaged simulators can only run a single simulation instance for brain training.  To scale up the simulator, we will need to push the Docker container to Azure Container Registry (ACR).  (Creating a Bonsai workspace automatically provisions an associated ACR instance.)

First log into ACR with

```sh
az acr login --name $RegistryName
```

Next, build the image on ACR with the Dockerfile.

```sh
az acr build \
    --image $ImageName \
    --registry $RegistryName \
    --file Dockerfile .
```

Finally, create a new simulator package in the Bonsai workspace.

```sh
bonsai simulator package container create \
    --name $SimulatorName \
    --image-uri "$RegistryName.azurecr.io/$ImageName" \
    --max-instance-count 25 \
    --cores-per-instance 1 \
    --memory-in-gb-per-instance 1 \
    --os-type Linux
```

Here

- `$RegistryName` is the name of your ACR instance,
- `$ImageName` is the name and tag of your container image, e.g. `hospital:v1`, and
- `$SimulatorName` is the name of your simulator in the Bonsai workspace, e.g. `Hospital`.

Note: On PowerShell, replace the backslashes ("\\") with backticks ("`").

### Brain Training

Now that the simulator is connected to the Bonsai platform, we can use it to train a brain.  First, create a new brain in the Bonsai workspace.

Next, upload the [Inkling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/inkling/basics) file [hospital.ink](./simpy_demo/hospital.ink) to the Bonsai workspace, and start a brain training session.  It takes around 30 minutes to train both lessons (see "Brain Design", below) to 100% goal satisfaction.

## Brain Design

There are 2 configuration parameters:

- the initial number of patients (0 by default), and
- the initial number of beds (200 by default).

The simulation keeps track of the following states:

- the simulation time (useful for plots and debugging),
- the number of beds in a given day,
- the number of patients in a given day,
- the number of patients turned away because no beds were available, and
- the utilization (the ratio of patients to beds).

The only possible action the brain can take is to change the number of beds.

### Utilization and Queue Theory

Modeling hospital capacity has important applications for policy and resourcing decisions - too few beds, and the hospital may not have capacity to serve an unexpected surge in patient arrivals; too many beds, and the resources are wasted.

One of the fundamental results of [queueing theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory) is that the customer (i.e. patient) wait time goes to infinity as the utilization approaches 100% (see, for example, [M/M/c queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M/M/c_queue)).

Government regulations and hospital policies have historically set utilization targets at 85%, although more recent research has challenged this assumption.  See Ref. [1](#ref1) for a good overview.

### Lesson Design

For our purposes, it is sufficient to choose a (somewhat arbitrary) target utilization and instruct the brain to keep the utilization within that range.

The first lesson (*StaticStart*) sets the initial number of beds at 200, and the brain learns to keep the utilization between 0.7 and 0.9.  The `within 14` clause requires the brain to reach the target utilization within 14 days for the training episode to be considered successful.

The second lesson (*RandomizeStart*) generalizes to between 200 and 300 beds in increments of 20.

Training episodes run for 2 years.

## Simulation Details

Each day a random number of patients arrive, where the arrival events are governed by a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), which is equivalent to modeling the inter-arrival times with an [exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution).

### Testing the Simulation

Let's use some simple control logic to test the simulation (see [demo_sim.py](./simpy_demo/demo_sim.py)):

- if the utilization is above 0.9, then add 25 beds;
- if the utilization is below 0.7, then remove 10 beds;
- otherwise, keep the beds as they are.

Running the simulation for 60 days with 200 beds and no patients (simulating a newly built hospital or wing) yields the following plot.

It takes around 2 weeks to reach a stable state, with a few days of overflow near the beginning.  After the initial ramp-up, the simple control logic works reasonably well, although it tends to overshoot the utilization targets before the logic kicks in.

The SimPy simulation in this demo is heavily inspired by Michael Allen's [*learninghospital* project](https://github.com/MichaelAllen1966/learninghospital/blob/master/simpy_envs/env_simple_hospital_bed_1.py).

The Bonsai simulation interface code, especially [main.py](./simpy_demo/main.py) and [interface.json](./simpy_demo/interface.json), is modeled after the `cartpole`, `plastic-extrusion`, and `simple-adder` examples in the [Bonsai API](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api).
